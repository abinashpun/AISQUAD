# Introduction
This repository contains the code framework for inference part of the face detection. 

# Face Recognition Pipeline
## Face Detection: 
Detect the region of face from photo (captured by webcam or input photo). The HOG + liner SVM based face detector from dlib is used
## Alignment: 
Align the detected face
## Normalization:
 Normalize the image pixel (face)
## Representation (Embedding):

## Classification
 (i.e. identifying person correspondig to face)
